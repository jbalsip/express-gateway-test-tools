# Testing Tools for express-gateway

The purpose of this package is to provide a set of tools to make it easier to write tests against custom plugin code that runs off of the [Express Gateway](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway).  Note that some tools may become obsolete dependent on what programmatic features are added to Express Gateway in the future.
